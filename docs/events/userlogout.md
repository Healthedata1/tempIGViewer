# userlogout

eventMaturity | [1 - Submitted](../../specification/STU1/#event-maturity-model)

## Workflow

User's session has ended, perhaps by exiting the application through a logout, session time-out or other reason.

Unlike most of FHIRcast events, `userlogout` is a statically named event and therefore does not follow the `FHIR-resource`-`[open|close]` syntax.

## Context

The context is empty.

### Examples

<mark>
```json
{
}
```
</mark>
